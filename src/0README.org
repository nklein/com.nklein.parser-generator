This is the main tree of sources for the parser generator itself.

The subdirectories here are:
* parser/
  This directory contains the files needed to parse the
  <parser_generator> XML into internal structures and the
  internal structures they parse into.  The source code in
  this directory is all autogenerated from the <parser_generator>
  XML in ../examples/parser_generator_parser.xml.

* generator/
  This is the meat of the parser generator.  It includes the
  (MAIN ...) function as well as the implementations that output
  Lisp parsers and Objective-C parsers.
