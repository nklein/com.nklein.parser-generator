The files here are:
* reader.lisp
  This file implements the parser.  You need this to turn XML
  into the types specified in [[*types.lisp]].  The only exported
  function here is (PARSE ..) it has two keyword arguments.
  You probably don't want to specify them.  They are
  [[*:root-path]] for overriding the "from" attribute that was
  on the <parser_generator> tag when I generated the parser,
  and *:root-type for overriding the "root" attribute that
  was on the <parser_generator> tag when I generated the parser.

** :root-path
   The root-path specifies the XML Path to the item you expect
   the parser to return.  Maybe, for your thing though, you've
   tucked the <parser_generator> XML inside a larger document
   and still want to use this parser to fetch it.

** :root-type
   The root-type specifies the data type the parser is expected
   to return.  I can't think of a reason you'd want to override
   this.  Maybe you're playing around and just want to try parsing
   a portion of the <parser_generator> XML.  Or, maybe you've got
   some super-dandy subclass of the pg-parser-generator class that
   you want to use instead (of course, you can't get the parser
   to use super-dandy subclasses of any its child types, so this
   is of limited utility).

* types.lisp
  This file contains all of the class declarations for the types
  required for the parsed version of the <parser_generator> XML.
  It has exported symbols for each class, each accessor, and
  each slot-name.  Hopefully, your lisp implementation doesn't
  mind if we export #:from and then export #:from again a few
  lines later.  8^)
