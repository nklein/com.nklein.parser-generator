<!--
This is the parser generator file for the accompanying menu.xml if
we're only interested in a minimal amount of information out of the
file. That file has a top-level tag <breakfast_menu>.  Under it are a
series of <food> tags.  Each <food> entry contains a <name>, <price>,
<description>, and <calories> tag.

Here, we want to turn it into a simple Menu struct with a version
field initialized from the top-level version attribute if present
(and defaulting to "1") and a menu items field that is just an
array of the names of the foods.

  <struct name="menu">
    <field type="integer" name="version" from="@version" default="1" />
    <field name="menu items">
      <array>
	<array_element type="string" from="/food/name/." />
      </array>
    </field>
  </struct>
</parser_generator>
